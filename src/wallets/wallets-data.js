        Coinbase, which went public in April, is the best known cryptocurrency exchange in the US. The company makes it easy to trade well-known cryptocurrencies from bitcoin to dogecoin, and has its own Visa-backed debit card that integrates with Apple Pay and Google. 
        If you're new to cryptocurrency, the Coinbase Wallet is a good place to start. It can be downloaded as an app for Android or iOS, the interface is intuitive and the wallet is fully integrated with the company's exchange, which makes it easy to conduct transactions -- including purchasing coins and tokens with traditional currency. 
        Unlike the company's exchange, the Coinbase Wallet is noncustodial; that means that only you have access to your wallet's private key, which is generated with a 12-word recovery phrase when you sign up. Note that there's a difference between storing your cryptocurrency on Coinbase's exchange, which is custodial, and the wallet, which is not. But the integration between them makes it fairly simple to transfer funds back and forth.

        Trezor's new user interface, Trezor Suite, just came out earlier this month, replacing the company's Wallet Web app. This analysis reflects our initial impression of a new product, therefore. But Trezor has been around for quite some time, established back in 2011 as a subsidiary of Czech-based SatoshiLabs. 
        The $255 Model T is Trezor's second-generation hardware wallet, and it comes with many of the same features as the Ledger Nano X, detailed below. One major difference is that Trezor's software is completely open-source, which affords some additional protection -- theoretically, at least: The code that powers the wallet is available for scrutiny, and, the thinking goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant. 
        Trezor Suite is designed to run natively on your desktop, which generally provides greater security than a web-based app, though you can also access Trezor Suite through the company's website. Trezor wallets currently support more than 1,800 coins and tokens, and you can make transactions directly in Trezor Suite with the company's integrated exchange. 
        Shaped like an old-school stopwatch, the Model T comes with a touchscreen and a USB cable to connect to your computer; it also features a microSD card if you want to add encrypted storage directly to your hardware wallet. It does not feature Bluetooth support, however -- an omission that some security advocates prefer, as Bluetooth connectivity could be an attack vector for hackers to exploit.
